#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### Run the Project

To run the Project clone the Project from my github:

$ git clone https://github.com/Jufaberlin/my-Udacity-Restaurant-Review

run the python server:

python -m http.server 8000

and open the Project in your browser:

http://localhost:8000

### Contribution

I was inspired by the Udacity Nanodegree Program Instructions, Udacity Knowledge, the Udacity Student Hub, by Stackoverflow, MDN, W3schools and Github.
